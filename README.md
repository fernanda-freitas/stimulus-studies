## Objective of the studies using Stimulus

In the exercise I practiced [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/), a modest JavaScript framework, in order to create a check-all mechanism.
To achieve that I used Stimulu's three core concepts of Data conrollers, Data actions and Data targets, as well as organization through Sitmululs architecture.
